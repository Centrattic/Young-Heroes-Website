        <h2> The Importance of Recognizing Youth Volunteers </h2>
        <p>Today’s youth are taking charge of environmental and social reforms, 
          and they deserve credit and appreciation where it’s due. Up to 55% of youth 
          actively participate in service, be it through school or other organizations, but they 
          have gone severely underrepresented of late. By commending their efforts, more youth will be 
          inspired to volunteer their time towards the community and the nation as a whole. Youth Service 
          America reminds us that adolescent brains in particular offer creative solutions to problems, 
          unaffected and unaware to the nonanswers common of some, older brains. They provide fresh outlooks 
          and ideas that would otherwise go unthought of. Youth service is mutually beneficial to both the 
          community and the youth in question; it has also been shown to improve success in the workforce 
          and academics in later life with early leadership foundations, as well as fostering positive 
          development traits and cosmopolitan mindsets. Some youth lack the incentive -the drive- to 
          go out and make a difference, which is why it is vital for them to have an outlet of support and recognition.  </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2> Our Mission Statement </h2>
        <p> The mission of the Young Heroes is to recognize Millburn/Short Hills youth for their contributions, 
          to promote community service and good citizenship, to positively impact the community, and to 
          give hope and inspiration to others, especially during difficult times such as COVID-19. 
          This will be accomplished through a nomination process, verification, parental approval, and 
          a final posting to the Millburn Township Young Heroes webpage. The posts will summarize the Young hero’s work
           and qualify them for an annual award given to the two heroes (and runners-ups) who demonstrate the most profound
          service and dedication to the Township, specific cause, and/or the community as a whole.

    and who, through their volunteer activities, have enhanced the quality of life in the Township of Millburn 
        and the community at large.”

      <h2> The History </h2>
      <p> The Millburn Township Community Service Award Committee (CSAC) was established in 1991 and has continued to "recognize and award members of the community who have 
        generously given their time, and who, through their volunteer activities, have enhanced the quality of life in the Township of Millburn and the community at large." 
        Learn more about the committee and the community service awards<a href = "https://twp.millburn.nj.us/188/Community-Service-Award-Committee">here.</a> 
        <br> <br>In 2021, Young Heroes is a new initiative that builds on the CSAC’s mission statement by creating an additional award category that recognizes the youth of the Millburn Township community.
         It was inspired and developed during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 by Scouts BSA Troop 19 Scout Riya Tyagi. As part of her Eagle Scout Project, Ms. Tyagi partnered with the CSAC to develop and support
          youth engagement in community service and created this website to facilitate nominations from the public. <br> <br> The only requirement to be eligible for an award is to be a Millburn Township resident or volunteer who does not receive any direct financial reward for their service.
